      <abstract>This part of the data release presents bathymetry data from the Elwha River delta collected in July 2018 (USGS Field Activity Number 2018-648-FA) using a kayak. The kayak was equipped with a single-beam echosounder and a survey-grade global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver.</abstract>
      <purpose>Data were obtained to assess the coastal geomorphic response following the removal of two dams on the Elwha River. These data are intended for science researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public. These data can be used with geographic information systems or other software to identify topographic and shallow-water bathymetric features.</purpose>

    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>A series of benchmarks with known coordinates were established adjacent to the study area to provide geodetic control for the bathymetric survey. The positions of the benchmarks were derived from a minimum of two static GNSS occupations. The equipment for the static occupations consisted of a dual frequency Trimble R7 GNSS receiver, a fixed-height tripod, and Trimble Geodetic Model 2 antenna. The static observations were recorded internally in the receiver and the raw observations were processed using the National Geodetic Survey Online Positioning User Service (OPUS, https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS/). Estimated uncertainties in the horizontal position of the individual GNSS occupations were provided by OPUS and ranged between 0.006 m and 0.06 m with an average horizontal uncertainty of 0.02 m. The processed positions from each occupation were averaged to obtain the final reported position of the benchmark. All final positions of the survey vessel were determined using differential corrections from the base station receivers. Manufacturer reported accuracy for the differentially corrected horizontal positions for the Trimble R10 rover trajectories is 0.8 cm + 0.5 ppm. Baselines from the GNSS base station were typically less than 5 km, suggesting a horizontal accuracy of survey-vessel positions to be 0.825 cm relative to the base station. The combined horizontal uncertainty from the base station coordinate solutions and rover trajectories is between 1.5 cm and 7 cm with a mean horizontal uncertainty of 3 cm. Uncertainty in the horizontal positions associated with pitch and roll of the survey vessel is unknown.</horizpar>
      </horizpa>
      <vertacc>
        <vertaccr>Uncertainty in the final elevations are derived from the combination of uncertainty in the GNSS positioning and bathymetric sounding measurements. Manufacturer reported accuracy for the differentially corrected vertical positions for the Trimble R10 rover trajectories is 1.5 cm + 1 ppm. Baselines from the GNSS base station were typically less than 5 km, suggesting the vertical accuracy of survey vessel positions to be 2 cm relative to the base station coordinate. Combining the uncertainty in the elevation of the base station coordinates and rover positions yields a total uncertainty in the GNSS-derived survey-vessel positions of approximately 5 cm. Additional uncertainty in the final computed elevations data is related to variability in the speed of sound used to compute depths from bathymetric soundings and, thus, are depth-dependent. The speed of sound in the river was not measured and we estimate the uncertainty in the final elevations to be 2 percent of water depth. The total vertical uncertainty is calculated using Equation 1: sigmat=sqrt(a^2+(b√ód)^2 ), where sigmat is the total vertical uncertainty, a is the uncertainty of the GNSS vertical position, b is the depth-dependent uncertainty factor (0.02), and d is water depth. Maximum water depths surveyed by the kayak are approximately 3 m yielding a maximum total vertical uncertainty of 8 cm. Uncertainty in the vertical positions associated with pitch and roll of the kayak is unknown.</vertaccr>

        <procdesc>Bathymetry data were collected on July 25 and 26, 2017 in the river channel and portions of the estuary using a kayak equipped with a SonarMite single-beam echosounder and 200 kHz transducer with a 4-degree beam angle. Depths from the kayak sonar were computed assuming a sound velocity of 1,460 m/s. Positioning of the kayak was determined at 1-Hz using a Trimble R10 integrated GNSS receiver and antenna operating in real-time kinematic (RTK) mode. Differential corrections were transmitted by a VHF radio to the GNSS receiver on the kayak at 1-Hz from a base station placed on a benchmark with known horizontal and vertical coordinates relative to the North American Datum of 1983 (CORS96 realization) and North American Vertical Datum of 1988. Bathymetric soundings and positioning data were recorded on a Trimble TSC2 data collector.</procdesc>
