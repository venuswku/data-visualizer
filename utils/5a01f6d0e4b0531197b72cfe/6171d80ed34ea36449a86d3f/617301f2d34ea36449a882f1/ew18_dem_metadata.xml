      <abstract>This portion of the USGS data release presents digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from bathymetric and topographic surveys conducted on the Elwha River delta in July 2018 (USGS Field Activity Number 2018-648-FA). Nearshore bathymetry data were collected using two personal watercraft (PWCs) and a kayak equipped with single-beam echosounders and survey-grade global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) receivers. Topographic data were collected on foot with survey-grade GNSS receivers mounted on backpacks. Positions of the survey platforms were referenced to a GNSS base station placed on a benchmark with known horizontal and vertical coordinates relative to the North American Datum of 1983 (CORS96 realization) and North American Vertical Datum of 1988 based on NGS Geoid09 vertical offsets. The final data were projected in Cartesian coordinates using the Washington State Plane North (meters) coordinate system. A total of 1,216,804 individual elevation points were collected within the survey area between July 23 and July 26, 2018. DEM surfaces were produced from all available elevation data using linear interpolation. Two separate DEMs were constructed. A DEM was produced that covered the entire survey area (approximately 511 ha) with 5-m horizontal resolution. A second DEM with 1-m resolution was produced that covered the river mouth and adjacent areas (approximately 131 ha). The DEMs were created by interpolating between measurements as much as 50 meters apart. For this reason, we cannot evaluate the accuracy of each point in the DEM, only the measurements it is based on. The estimated vertical uncertainties of the bathymetric and topographic measurements are 12 and 5 cm, respectively. Digital data files for each DEM are provided in ESRI ARC ASCII (*.asc) format.</abstract>
      <purpose>Data were obtained to assess the coastal geomorphic response following the removal of two dams on the Elwha River. These data are intended for science researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public. These data can be used with geographic information systems or other software to identify topographic and shallow-water bathymetric features.</purpose>

    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>Digital elevation models (DEMs) are created by interpolating between elevation measurements as much as 50 meters apart, for this reason we cannot evaluate the accuracy of each point in a DEM, only the original data from which it is generated. The horizontal accuracy of the individual points was assessed based on the combined uncertainty of GNSS base stations and kinematic (rover) data points. Manufacturer-reported accuracy for the differentially corrected horizontal positions for the Trimble R7, R8 and R10 receivers used to collect the topographic and bathymetric measurements is 0.8 cm + 0.5 ppm. Baselines from the GNSS base station were typically less than 5 km, suggesting a horizontal accuracy of survey-vessel positions to be 0.825 cm relative to the base station. The combined horizontal uncertainty from the base station coordinate solutions and rover trajectories is between 1.5 cm and 7 cm, with a mean horizontal uncertainty of 3 cm. Uncertainty in the horizontal positions associated with pitch and roll of the survey vessels and variable surveyor posture during the backpack surveys is unknown.</horizpar>

        <vertaccr>Digital elevation models (DEMs) are created by interpolating between elevation measurements as much as 50 meters apart, for this reason we cannot evaluate the accuracy of each point in a DEM, only the original data from which it is generated. An estimated vertical accuracy of 5 cm for the topographic GNSS backpack survey platforms was estimated by combining uncertainty in the base station coordinates and the manufacturer reported vertical accuracy of 1.5 cm + 1 ppm for differential corrected kinematic data. Additional uncertainty in the final computed elevations in the bathymetry data is related to unmeasured variability in the speed of sound used to compute depths from bathymetric soundings and, thus, are depth dependent. Based on analysis of all available sound velocity casts, we estimate the uncertainty in the final elevations to be 0.6 percent of water depth. The total vertical uncertainty is calculated using the standard equation sigmat=v(a^2+(b×d)^2), where sigmat is the total vertical uncertainty, a is the uncertainty of the GNSS vertical position, b is the depth-dependent uncertainty factor (0.006), and d is water depth (International Hydrographic Organization, 2008). Maximum water depths surveyed by the personal watercraft are approximately 18 m, yielding a maximum total vertical uncertainty of 12 cm.</vertaccr>
