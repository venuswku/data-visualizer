      <abstract>This part of the data release presents topography data from the Elwha River delta collected in July 2017. Topography data were collected on foot with global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers mounted on backpacks.</abstract>
      <purpose>Data were obtained to assess the coastal geomorphic response following the removal of two dams on the Elwha River. These data are intended for science researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public. These data can be used with geographic information systems or other software to identify topographic and shallow-water bathymetric features.</purpose>

    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>A series of benchmarks with known coordinates were established adjacent to the study area to provide geodetic control for the bathymetric and topographic surveys. The positions of the benchmarks were derived from a minimum of two static GNSS occupations. The equipment for the static occupations consisted of a dual frequency Trimble R7 GNSS receiver, a fixed-height tripod, and Trimble Geodetic Model 2 antenna. The static observations were recorded internally in the receiver and the raw observations were processed using the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) Online Positioning User Service (OPUS, https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS/). Estimated uncertainties in the horizontal position of the individual GNSS occupations were provided by OPUS and ranged between 0.006 m and 0.06 m with an average horizontal uncertainty of 0.02 m. The processed positions from each occupation were averaged to obtain the final reported position of the benchmark. All final positions of the GNSS backpacks were determined using differential corrections from the base station receivers. Manufacturer reported accuracy for the differentially corrected horizontal positions for the Trimble R7, R8, and R10 receivers used in the survey is 0.8 cm + 0.5 ppm. Baselines from the GNSS base station were typically less than 5 km, suggesting a horizontal accuracy of backpack positions to be 0.825 cm relative to the base station. The combined horizontal uncertainty from the base station coordinate solutions and rover trajectories is therefore approximately 3 cm. Uncertainty in the horizontal positions associated with variable posture during data collection of the surveyors is unknown.</horizpar>
      </horizpa>
      <vertacc>
        <vertaccr>The vertical uncertainty of topographic measurements is estimated by combining the uncertainty in the base station coordinate and remote GNSS positions collected in kinematic mode. Uncertainties in the elevation of the base station were provided by NGS OPUS and ranged between 0.02 m and 0.04 m, with an average vertical uncertainty of 0.03 m. Manufacturer reported vertical accuracy in the rover positions is 1.5 cm + 1 ppm for differential corrected kinematic data for the Trimble R7, R8 and R10 receivers used in the surveys. Baseline lengths were typically less than 5 km, suggesting the vertical accuracy of backpack positions to be 2 cm relative to the base station coordinates. Combining the uncertainty in the elevation of the base station coordinates and rover positions yields a total uncertainty in the backpack GNSS positions of approximately 5 cm. Uncertainty in the vertical positions associated with variable posture of the surveyors during data collection is unknown.</vertaccr>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Topography data were collected between July 20 and July 23, 2017 on foot with GNSS equipment mounted on backpacks operating primarily in real-time kinematic (RTK) mode. A total of 5 GNSS backpacks, each equipped with a dual-frequency GNSS receiver and handheld data collector, were used during the survey. Differential corrections were transmitted at 1-Hz intervals by a VHF radio to the backpack GNSS receivers from a GNSS base station placed on a benchmark with known horizontal and vertical coordinates relative to the North American Datum of 1983 (CORS96 realization) and North American Vertical Datum of 1988. Prior to data collection, vertical distances between the GNSS antenna and the ground were measured using a tape measure for each topographic surveyor. Hand-held data collectors were used to log raw data and display navigational information allowing surveyors to navigate along predefined survey lines spaced at 25- to 50-m intervals along the delta. Profiles were surveyed from the landward edge of the primary dune over the beach foreshore, to wading depth on the same series of transects as the nearshore bathymetry platforms. Additional topography data between transects were collected to better characterize morphologic variability within the study area.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Raw topography data were reviewed in either Trimble Geomatics Office (TGO) or Trimble Business Center (TBC) to ensure measured antenna offsets were applied properly in the field. Differential post-processing was performed on points collected in autonomous mode where VHF communication with the base station failed. All available topography data were compiled and exported in comma-separated text file for distribution.</procdesc>
