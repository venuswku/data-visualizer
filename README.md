# Data Visualizer
Learn more about how to use this data viewer from the [Wiki](https://github.com/venuswku/data-visualizer/wiki).

## Create an Environment with Anaconda
Create a new environment named `visualizer` with all the required packages by entering the following commands in succession into Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux):
```
conda create -n visualizer python=3.10 -y
conda activate visualizer
# Install Panel dependencies.
conda install -c pyviz panel -y
# Install dependencies to plot datasets.
conda install -c pyviz geoviews spatialpandas holoviews -y
conda install -c conda-forge dask-geopandas rioxarray geopandas cartopy jupyterlab -y
```
If you want to download data from [ScienceBase](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/4f4e4760e4b07f02db47df9c) or preprocess data, then run the following commands to install the required dependencies. Make sure the environment is activated before you run these commands.
```
conda install -c conda-forge requests pip -y
pip install sciencebasepy
```

## Launch Jupyter Notebook as a Web Server
- Make sure your Anaconda environment is activated by running `conda activate visualizer` in your terminal.
- Run the command `panel serve --show --autoreload app.ipynb` in your terminal.
- A webpage with the URL http://localhost:5006/app will display all Panel objects marked with `.servable()`.
- Any changes in the notebook will automatically be reflected on the webpage. Just in case, refresh the webpage to make sure you see your latest changes.

## Launch Jupyter Notebook
- Make sure your Anaconda environment is activated by running `conda activate visualizer` in your terminal.
- Run the command `jupyter notebook` in your terminal.
- Open the `app.ipynb` file when a webpage with the URL http://localhost:8888/tree appears.
  - Directly running `jupyter notebook app.ipynb` will skip this step of selecting a notebook to open.
- Run all the notebook cells from top to bottom. The Panel app will be outputted after the last cell is run.
- Reload the [`app.ipynb` webpage](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/app.ipynb) when you want to see your new changes.
